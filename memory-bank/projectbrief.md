# Voboost Service - Project Brief

## Primary Goal
Create an Android service for Voyah vehicles (Free, Dreamer) that applies configuration settings to vehicle systems with reliable background operation and seamless integration with the voboost-config library.

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Android background service operation within vehicle systems
- Configuration file monitoring and hot-reload
- Vehicle system configuration application
- Configuration validation and error recovery
- Service lifecycle management (start, stop, restart)
- Configuration rollback on failures
- Vehicle system health monitoring and status reporting

### Technical Requirements
- **Target Platform**: Android 9 and Android 11 only
- **Vehicle Models**: Voyah Free, Voyah Dreamer
- Kotlin/Android as primary development language
- Integration with voboost-config through dependency
- Android service frameworks and background processing
- Vehicle system API integration for configuration application
- Automotive-grade reliability and performance

### Vehicle Integration Requirements
- Use voboost-config for all configuration operations
- Result<T> pattern for consistent error handling
- Vehicle system monitoring for configuration changes
- Vehicle system permission handling
- Configuration backup and restore capabilities
- Integration with Voyah vehicle software stack

## Architectural Principles
- Android service architecture patterns
- Event-driven vehicle configuration processing
- Asynchronous operation handling with Android components
- Centralized vehicle configuration management
- Vehicle system abstraction for different models

## Success Criteria
- Reliable Android background service operation
- Seamless integration with voboost-config library
- Stable operation on Android 9 and 11
- Robust vehicle configuration application and monitoring
- Vehicle system integration capabilities
- Professional automotive-grade service management

## Constraints and Assumptions
- Android 9 and 11 compatibility only
- Voyah Free and Dreamer vehicle models only
- Dependency on voboost-config library
- Requires vehicle system-level permissions for configuration application
- Vehicle hardware and system constraints
- Integration with existing Voyah vehicle software stack

- voboost: Android app for vehicle configuration interface
- voboost-codestyle: Common code style rules for all Voboost projects

## Service Architecture

### Core Components
- **Configuration Monitor**: Watches for configuration file changes using Android file observers
- **Configuration Processor**: Applies configurations to Voyah vehicle systems
- **Service Manager**: Handles Android service lifecycle and health monitoring
- **Vehicle Integrator**: Voyah-specific vehicle system integration
- **Error Handler**: Manages errors and rollback procedures for vehicle systems

### Vehicle System Integration
- **Voyah Free**: Model-specific system integration and configuration options
- **Voyah Dreamer**: Model-specific system integration and configuration options
- **Vehicle APIs**: Integration with Voyah vehicle system APIs
- **System Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of vehicle system state

### Configuration Flow
1. Monitor configuration file changes using Android FileObserver
2. Validate configuration using voboost-config library
3. Create backup of current vehicle system state
4. Apply configuration to Voyah vehicle systems
5. Verify successful application through vehicle system feedback
6. Handle errors and rollback if necessary using vehicle APIs
7. Log results and update service status
8. Notify vehicle systems and user interface of changes

### Android Service Features
- Foreground service for reliable background operation
- Service binding for communication with main app
- Broadcast receivers for system events
- Work manager integration for scheduled tasks
- Android system integration (notifications, permissions)
