# Voboost Service - Project Intelligence

## Global Rules (CRITICAL)
- This project follows ALL common rules from ../voboost-codestyle/.clinerules
- The rules below are PROJECT-SPECIFIC additions to the global rules
- NEVER duplicate global rules here - they are inherited automatically

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Application Architecture
- Android background service for Voyah vehicles (Free, Dreamer models)
- Integration with voboost-config library for configuration reading
- Vehicle system integration capabilities
- Android 9 and Android 11 compatibility only

### Technology Stack
- Kotlin/Android for service development
- Android Services with foreground operation
- voboost-config library integration for configuration handling
- Vehicle system API integration for configuration application
- Android Architecture Components for service management

### Service Patterns
- Android foreground service for reliable background operation
- Configuration file monitoring using Android FileObserver
- Vehicle system configuration application
- Service binding for communication with main app
- Android system integration (notifications, permissions, work manager)

### Integration Approach
- voboost-config library as dependency for configuration operations
- Result pattern for consistent error handling
- Vehicle system API integration for configuration application
- Service lifecycle management with Android components
- Integration with Voyah vehicle software stack

## Critical Implementation Details

### Configuration Application
- Read configuration from voboost-config files
- Apply vehicle-specific settings based on configuration
- Handle configuration validation and error recovery
- Support for Voyah Free and Dreamer model differences
- Rollback capabilities for failed vehicle configurations

### Android Service Management
- Proper foreground service implementation
- Service status monitoring and health checks
- Automatic restart on failure using Android mechanisms
- Configuration reload without service restart
- Android system integration (startup, shutdown, logging)

### Vehicle System Integration
- Voyah-specific vehicle system implementation
- Vehicle system permission handling
- Configuration backup and restore for vehicle state
- Vehicle system state monitoring
- Integration with Voyah vehicle APIs and software stack

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of invalid configurations
- Vehicle system-level error recovery
- Service failure handling and recovery using Android patterns
- Configuration rollback on vehicle system errors
- Comprehensive logging for vehicle diagnostics

## Development Workflow (Project-Specific)
- Service should operate reliably as Android background service
- All changes should maintain automotive-grade reliability standards
- Integration with voboost-config library should be seamless
- Android 9 and 11 compatibility must be maintained
- Vehicle integration should follow Voyah platform standards

## Project Status
- INITIAL SETUP PHASE
- Android service architecture planning in progress
- Vehicle integration patterns to be established
- Voyah-specific system integration to be developed
- Memory bank documentation initialized

## Key Success Factors
- Reliable Android background service operation
- Seamless integration with voboost-config library
- Stable operation on Android 9 and 11
- Robust vehicle configuration application and monitoring
- Vehicle system integration capabilities
- Professional automotive-grade service management and monitoring
- Model-specific support for Voyah Free and Dreamer vehicles
